# Revenue Projections

**Last Updated:** December 14, 2025  
**Scenarios:** Conservative (Bootstrap) and Aggressive (VC-Backed)

---

## Overview

This document presents two growth scenarios for SimAgent:

1. **Conservative Scenario:** Bootstrap-funded, organic growth, profitability-focused
2. **Aggressive Scenario:** VC-backed, hypergrowth, market-share focused

Both scenarios are grounded in realistic assumptions about iOS testing market dynamics, customer acquisition,and retention.

## Market Sizing Foundation

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

**Global iOS Developer Base:**
- Total iOS developers worldwide: ~5 million
- Working on team projects (not hobby): ~1 million  
- Working on projects requiring automated testing: ~500K
- **TAM: $500M-1B annual spend on iOS testing tools**

### Market Segmentation

| Segment | Companies | ARPU | Potential Revenue |
|---------|-----------|------|-------------------|
| **Individual/Small** | 50K | $1.2K/year | $60M |
| **Mid-Market Teams** | 10K | $6K/year | $60M |
| **Enterprise** | 1K | $60K/year | $60M |
| **Agencies** | 2K | $18K/year | $36M |
| **Total TAM** | 63K | - | **$216M** |

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

**Realistic Market Share Targets:**
- Year 1: 0.1% of TAM = $216K ARR
- Year 3: 1% of TAM = $2.16M ARR
- Year 5: 5% of TAM = $10.8M ARR
- **Ceiling: 10% = $21.6M ARR** (market leader position)

**Reality Check:**
iOS testing is more niche than error monitoring (Sentry: $150M+ ARR) or CI/CD (CircleCI: $100M+ ARR). Realistic ceiling is $20-50M ARR unless significant market expansion.

## Recommended Path: Hybrid Approach

### Phase 1: Bootstrap Validation (Months 1-12)

**Goal:** Reach $10K-50K MRR with minimal capital

- Self-fund or small angel ($100-250K)
- Focus on product-market fit
- Organic growth only
- Target: 100-200 paying customers

**Decision Point (Month 12):**
- If growing 20%+ MoM → Consider raising Seed
- If growing 10-20% MoM → Continue bootstrap
- If growing <10% MoM → Pivot or reassess

### Phase 2: Optionality (Months 12-24)

**Scenario A: Strong Traction (30%+ MoM)**
→ Raise Seed ($2-3M) and pursue aggressive path

**Scenario B: Moderate Traction (15-30% MoM)**
→ Raise smaller seed ($1M) or continue bootstrap

**Scenario C: Slow Traction (<15% MoM)**
→ Stay bootstrap, focus on profitability

### Phase 3: Scale or Exit (Months 24-48)

**If bootstrapped:**
- Reach $2-5M ARR
- Field acquisition offers
- Choose: Exit or continue independent

**If VC-backed:**
- Raise Series A
- Scale to $10-20M ARR
- Pursue larger exit or IPO track

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Impact of Growth Rate on Exit Value (Conservative)

| Annual Growth Rate | Year 3 ARR | Exit Multiple | Exit Value |
|--------------------|------------|---------------|------------|
| **50% (Low)** | $1.1M | 6x | $6.6M |
| **100% (Base)** | $1.8M | 8x | $14.4M |
| **150% (High)** | $3.0M | 10x | $30M |

### Impact of Market Share on ARR (Year 5)

| Market Share | ARR | Exit Value (8x) | Notes |
|--------------|-----|-----------------|-------|
| **1%** | $2.2M | $17.6M | Niche player |
| **3%** | $6.5M | $52M | Strong position |
| **5%** (base) | $10.8M | $86M | Market leader |
| **10%** | $21.6M | $173M | Dominant (unlikely) |

---

## Conclusion

### Conservative Scenario

**Best For:**
- Founders optimizing for control and lower risk
- First-time founders
- Capital-constrained situations
- Those satisfied with $13-45M outcome

**Risks:**
- Slower growth may allow competitors to dominate
- Limited resources may constrain product development
- Smaller exit opportunities

### Aggressive Scenario

**Best For:**
- Experienced founders
- Those optimizing for largest possible outcome
- Access to top-tier VC funding
- Market-domination mindset

**Risks:**
- High dilution (75-85%)
- VC pressure and board control
- Higher failure rate (70% of VC startups fail)
- May overshoot market size

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

**Start bootstrapped, maintain optionality, scale when traction is clear.**

This approach:
- De-risks with real market validation
- Preserves founder equity early
- Allows rational choice at 12-18 months
- Optimizes founder outcome regardless of path

---

**Bottom Line:** Both scenarios are viable. Conservative path offers better founder economics ($13-45M with 80-90% ownership) vs aggressive path ($22-100M with 15-25% ownership). The hybrid approach lets data decide which path makes sense.
