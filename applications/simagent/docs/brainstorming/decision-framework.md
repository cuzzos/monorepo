## Score Interpretation

### 8.0-10.0: STRONG PURSUE 🟢
**Recommendation:** This is an excellent opportunity for you. Pursue with confidence.

**Next steps:**
1. Conduct 20 customer discovery interviews (Month 1)
2. Build proof-of-concept (Maestro + AI Vision)
3. Validate unit economics (<$0.50 per test)
4. Land 3 consulting clients to validate willingness to pay
5. Commit full-time by Month 6

**Financial path:** Bootstrap or raise small angel round ($250K-500K)  
**Timeline:** 3-5 years to $30-50M strategic exit  
**Confidence:** High (70-80% success probability)

---

### 6.0-7.9: QUALIFIED PURSUE 🟡
**Recommendation:** Opportunity has merit, but address weak areas first.

**Common weak areas and fixes:**
- **Weak iOS expertise?** → Find technical co-founder with iOS depth
- **Limited runway?** → Raise small angel round or start as side project
- **Uncertain market?** → Conduct 30-50 customer interviews before committing
- **Technical concerns?** → Build proof-of-concept to validate feasibility

**Next steps:**
1. Identify your 2-3 weakest scores
2. Create specific plan to strengthen each (3-6 months)
3. Re-evaluate using this framework
4. Proceed only if score improves to 7+

**Financial path:** De-risked consulting path → tool → platform  
**Timeline:** 4-6 years (slower, more cautious)  
**Confidence:** Medium (40-60% success probability)

---

### 4.0-5.9: MARGINAL - RECONSIDER 🟠
**Recommendation:** Significant concerns exist. Reconsider or substantially de-risk.

**High-risk scenarios:**
- Total score <6 usually means fundamental mismatch
- Section 1 (Founder Fit) <2.0 is usually fatal
- Section 2 (Market) <1.5 suggests wrong opportunity

**Options:**
1. **Pivot the approach** - Different market segment? (Enterprise vs SMB?)
2. **Find strong co-founder** - Fill gaps in expertise
3. **Validate differently** - Start with consulting to learn deeply
4. **Reconsider entirely** - Maybe this isn't the right opportunity

**If you still want to proceed:**
- Treat as high-risk experiment
- Set clear kill criteria (e.g., "If not at $5K MRR by Month 9, stop")
- Invest minimally (<$50K) until validation

**Confidence:** Low (20-40% success probability)

---

### <4.0: STOP - DON'T PURSUE 🔴
**Recommendation:** This opportunity is not a good fit. Move on.

**Common reasons for scores <4:**
- No iOS expertise (can't be fixed quickly)
- Haven't experienced the pain (weak product intuition)
- Market is too small or too competitive
- Can't bootstrap and can't raise capital

**Better alternatives:**
- Find a problem you've personally struggled with
- Work at a company in this space to learn (BrowserStack, Sauce Labs)
- Explore adjacent opportunities with better fit
- Focus on opportunities scoring 7+

**Don't make these mistakes:**
- ❌ "I'll learn iOS as I build" - too slow
- ❌ "I'll pivot if this doesn't work" - pivot to what?
- ❌ "But I really want to do this" - passion without fit leads to failure

## Weighted Decision Criteria

Some factors matter more than others. Use these critical filters:

### Critical Filters (Must Pass ALL)

| Filter | Minimum | Your Score | Pass? |
|--------|---------|------------|-------|
| **iOS Expertise** | 7/10 | ___ | ☐ |
| **Financial Runway** | 6/10 | ___ | ☐ |
| **Problem Severity** | 7/10 | ___ | ☐ |
| **Technical Feasibility** | 7/10 | ___ | ☐ |

**If you fail ANY critical filter → STOP**

These are non-negotiable. Even if overall score is high, failing a critical filter is disqualifying.

## Scenario-Based Recommendations

### Scenario A: Strong iOS Developer, Limited Runway
**Profile:** 7+ years iOS, $50K saved, can't go 18 months without income

**Recommendation:** **Consulting Path**
1. Keep day job (negotiate part-time if possible)
2. Land 2-3 consulting clients ($5K-10K each)
3. Build CLI tool with consulting revenue
4. Quit when MRR > minimum salary

**Timeline:** 12-18 months to full-time, 3-4 years to exit  
**Risk:** Medium (slower, but de-risked)

---

### Scenario B: iOS Expert, Strong Runway, No Co-Founder
**Profile:** 10/10 iOS expertise, $200K saved, solo founder

**Recommendation:** **Full-Time Bootstrap**
1. Build MVP solo (3-6 months)
2. Launch on Product Hunt / HN
3. Get to $10K MRR (Month 6-9)
4. Hire contractors as needed (design, marketing)
5. Reach $100K MRR (Month 18-24)

**Timeline:** 3 years to $2M ARR, potential exit Year 4-5  
**Risk:** Medium-low (strong founder-market fit)

---

### Scenario C: iOS Developer, Wants VC Funding
**Profile:** 5 years iOS, ambitious, wants to build big fast

**Recommendation:** **YC → Seed Path**
1. Build MVP (3 months)
2. Get 20-50 early users
3. Apply to YC or similar accelerator
4. Raise seed from bootstrapper-friendly fund ($2-3M)
5. Aggressive growth (80% revenue to S&M)

**Timeline:** 2 years to $5M ARR, exit Year 3-4  
**Risk:** Higher (VC pressure, dilution), but faster

---

### Scenario D: Non-Technical, Domain Expert
**Profile:** Product manager at Apple, deep iOS knowledge, can't code

**Recommendation:** **Find Technical Co-Founder**
1. Network for 3-6 months to find iOS engineer co-founder
2. Validate together through customer interviews
3. Co-founder builds MVP while you do GTM
4. Raise small angel round ($250K-500K)

**Timeline:** 6 months to find co-founder, then 4-5 years to exit  
**Risk:** High (co-founder search is hard, relationship risk)

---

### Scenario E: Side Project
**Profile:** Full-time job (can't quit), want to explore

**Recommendation:** **Nights & Weekends MVP**
1. Build proof-of-concept (3 months, 10 hours/week)
2. Launch on side project directories (Indie Hackers, etc.)
3. See if you get traction ($1-2K MRR)
4. Decision point: Quit or stay side project

**Timeline:** 12+ months to decision point  
**Risk:** Low (keeping day job), but opportunity cost (slow progress)
