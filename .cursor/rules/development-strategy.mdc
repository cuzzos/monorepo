# Development Strategy: Outside-In / Walking Skeleton

## Core Principle

Build from the outside (production environment) inward:

1. **Infrastructure** - Deployment, hosting, database connection working first
2. **Integration** - End-to-end "hello world" through all layers (tracer bullet)
3. **Auth** - Shapes routing, middleware, and API design
4. **Features** - Built on working, deployed foundation

## Tracer Bullet

A thin, end-to-end slice through all layers that proves the system works:

```
User action → Frontend → API → Database → Response → UI update
```

Even if each layer does almost nothing, you've proven deployment and integration work.

## Walking Skeleton

A tiny implementation that performs a small end-to-end function. No muscle (features) yet, but the bones (architecture) are in place and it can "walk" (deploy and run).

## Why This Order

| Problem | Outside-In Solves It |
|---------|---------------------|
| "Works on my machine" | Deployment proven from day 1 |
| Integration surprises | CORS, env vars, networking solved early |
| Auth bolted on later | Auth shapes everything; do it early |
| Deployment panic at launch | Already done, just push features |

## For AI Agents

When starting new features or projects:

1. **Can this deploy right now?** If not, fix infrastructure first.
2. **Does a tracer bullet exist?** Build thin end-to-end path before adding features.
3. **Is auth wired up?** Many features depend on knowing the user.
4. **Only then:** Implement feature logic, working outward-to-inward.

When asked to "build X feature":
- First verify the deployment pipeline works
- Then verify you can hit the API from the frontend
- Then add the feature on this working foundation
